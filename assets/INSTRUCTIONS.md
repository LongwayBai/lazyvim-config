# How to Add the intro.gif

To complete the setup and have the GIF display properly in the README files:

1. Download or create a GIF file that demonstrates your LazyVim configuration
2. Name the file `intro.gif`
3. Place it in this `assets` directory

The README files (README.md and README_EN.md) are already configured to reference `./assets/intro.gif`.

## Alternative: Use a Public URL

If you prefer to host the GIF externally, you can:
1. Upload the GIF to GitHub by creating an issue or discussion
2. Copy the permanent URL (should start with `https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/...`)
3. Replace `./assets/intro.gif` in both README files with that URL

Note: The previous private URL with JWT tokens expires and only works temporarily.
